# Initial project plan and motivations
## Motivations
After losing ~5 games of Klondike solitaire in a row, I wondered what the winrate with optimal play was in Solitaire. Turns out that is actually a very difficult question. I had expected that there was likely a mathematical proof of both optimal play and of the achievable winrate. But the problem turned out to be much more complicated. In fact, most research in the topic has been on a variation where hidden cards are known to the player. In this version of , the achievable winrate has been estimated to be about ~82% (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.12314.pdf). But in most cases Klondike is played with hidden cards and this modification greatly affects the winrate. This report (http://www.jupiterscientific.org/sciinfo/KlondikeSolitaireReport.html) estimates that the optimal winrate for Klondike with hidden cards is likely at least 43%, using a sample of 443 games by a human player. But this is really only a lower bound since better play may be possible than the human player. The goal is to build a AI to play Klondike at a super-human level, specifically to perform above 43% to increase the floor of possible winrate.
